I'm currently reading Luster by Raven Leilani, which follows a Black woman in
her twenties who gets involved with a fortysomething white man in an open marriage.
So far, I've really been enjoying the way Leilani explores her main character's
identity as a somewhat lost Black woman and how that impacts her relationship
with society and of course with specific individuals.
